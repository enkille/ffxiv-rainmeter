# FFXIV Rainmeter HUD
I haven't actually worked on this project in 8 years, but this seems like the easiest way to share it. This was initially posted on the [FFXIV subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/1k6gt5/ffxiv_rainmeter_hud_download_link_inside/).

## Original Reddit Post Text
Intro: For some background, this is my first Rainmeter skin. I basically learned (or attempted to learn) Rainmeter *while* creating this, so things may be done inefficiently. Having said that, I created this skin as a project to keep me busy until FFXIV release. I did have fun making this, so I may piddle with it more in the future.

Everything that needs to be configured should be able to be set up through the @Resources\include.inc file. This skin does also come packaged with a layout, which will load the skins in the proper configuration on your desktop.
